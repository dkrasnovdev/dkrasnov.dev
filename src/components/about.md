## About me

Hey! I'm Dmitry, a versatile programmer who loves taking the initiative and has a real passion for coding.

I've studied at [**Siberian Federal University**](https://sfu-kras.ru/en), earning a Bachelor's degree in **Applied Informatics** and a Master's degree in **Information Systems & Technology**.

Programming is more than just a job to me – it's a genuine interest and a personal pursuit. I enjoy using the latest tools to make coding smooth and crafting user-friendly products that hit the mark.

I value an active lifestyle. I believe in keeping both mind and body in shape. It's a principle I think applies universally – a healthy body sets the stage for success in any field.

Life, to me, is all about embracing the simple joys and maintaining an optimistic outlook. This mindset fuels my curiosity and open-minded approach, both of which are vital in the ever-evolving world of software development. I'm always keen on learning and staying up-to-date with new ideas and technologies.

Thank you for visiting and getting to know a bit about me. Feel free to contact me – I'm always up for a conversation!
