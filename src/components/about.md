## About me

Hey! I'm Dmitry. Iâ€™m a polyglot programmer, self-starter and coding enthusiast. I use TypeScript and Go professionally, but programming is both a hobby and a profession for me.

I am passionate about using new tools to get the best developer experience and build products with seamless user experience. I am constantly following the progress of the software engineering world.
